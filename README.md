# Anker Whinch Remote Control
Small Note: This is my first Public projct on GitHub so some things might be a bit messy ðŸ™ƒ

## Project Outline
The project aims  to create a remote control for the anker winch on a sailing/ motor yacht. 
Retrofitting a system is expensive and I thought this might be a cool little project to pursue.
The Anchor chain I am working with is the "Lofran's Tigres", however this project should work with most of the models and brands.
(Product Example: https://www.lofrans.com/product/75-hand-held-controls/6600-lofrans-radio-control-chaincounter-thetis-7003 - approx. 250 â‚¬)

## Goals
- Controling whinch movement (Up/ Down) wirelessly **Achieved**
- Meassuring chain length and displaying it on the remote

## Project Status - 28. Jul. 2024
Currently the remote remote hardware is designed and capable of fullfiling all project goals. 
The Winch is connected to the Double-Relay which is able to comunicate with the remote control and control the winch. 

A chain counting mechanism is not implemented yet.
